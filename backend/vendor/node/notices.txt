     # foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term

    5. Time Zone Database
    ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from
    Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained
    in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
    Database section 7.

    7.  Database Ownership

       The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
       document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
       that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
       domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
       to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
       Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
       the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
       this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
       currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
       orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
       on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
       database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
       contribution or in the TZ Database.

    The Artistic License 2.0

    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
    Package available as open source and free software.

    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
    a different licensing arrangement.

    Definitions

        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
        procedures.

        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
        distribute, or modify the Package.

        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
        Version, or a Modified Version.

        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
        by the Copyright Holder.

        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
        Holder.

        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
        configuration files for the Package.

        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
        translation of the Source form.

    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
    Compiled form of the Package.

    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
    will be subject to the Original License.

    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
    you do at least ONE of the following:

        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
        Version.

        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
        from the name of the Standard Version.

        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
        under

            (i)  the Original License or

            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
            Fees are allowed.

    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
    or Modified Versions without the Source

    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
    the Source of the Modified Version.

    Aggregating or Linking the Package

    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
    as included in the aggregation.

    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
    terms of this license.

    General Provisions

    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
    license.

    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
    this license.

    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
    date that such litigation is filed.

    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
    LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *          the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *      the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
 *      License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

B.8 - Perl 5.10.1

Perl 5.  Artistic License:

- Perl 5.10.1

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under
the Artistic License (source code available via the indicated URL):" http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html

        The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
        Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
        semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
        while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
        the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
        reasonable modifications.

        Definitions:

            "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
            Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
            created through textual modification.

            "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
            modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
            of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

            "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
            copyrights for the package.

            "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
            this Package.

            "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
            basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
            and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
            Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
            as a market that must bear the fee.)

            "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
            itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
            It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
            under the same conditions they received it.

        1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
        Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
        duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

        2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
        derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
        modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

        3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
        that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
        when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
        following:

            a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
            Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
            an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
            site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
            your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

            b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

            c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
            with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
            a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
            documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

            d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

        4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
        executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

            a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
            together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
            to get the Standard Version.

            b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
            the Package with your modifications.

            c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
            document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
            with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

            d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

        5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
        Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
        Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
        you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
        commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
        distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
        product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
        an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
        form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
        interpreter is so embedded.

        6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
        output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
        under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
        them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
        Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
        Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
        binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
        neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
        fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
        not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
        Package.

        7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
        languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
        emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
        Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
        equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
        not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
        regression tests for the language.

        8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
        permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
        when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
        to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
        construed as a distribution of this Package.

        9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
        products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

        10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
